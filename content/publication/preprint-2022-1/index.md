abstract: It is clear that the world of digital is here to stay. Online technologies are increasingly important for children, providing access to vital education, socialisation, participation, well-being, and entertainment resources. This rapid adoption and increasing reliance on the online world has raised corresponding concerns about the long-term effects of data/ication, in which childrenâ€™s actions are pervasively recorded, tracked, aggregated, analysed, and exploited by online services in multiple ways that include behavioural engineering, and monetisation.
