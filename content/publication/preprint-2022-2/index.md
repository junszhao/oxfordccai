abstract: This written evidence is submitted by Dr Jun Zhao (Senior research fellow) and Ms Ge Wang (Final year DPhil student) on behalf of Oxford University’s Child-Centred AI initiative. We welcome the considerations urged by the Online Safety Bill committee and we would like to add some additional comments in this response as we thought it’s critical to strengthen the requirements for more transparency and more support for users’ agency, and a separation between the content vs. system harms.
