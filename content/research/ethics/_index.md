While there is a plethora of AI ethics principles, very few have considered from children’s perspective. 

OxfordCCAI has taken a deep dive of the current AI ethics principles globally, consolidated their terminologies and discussions, and contextualised them against children’s context, to see how they may related to children. We drew on the UNCRC’s framework on children’s rights in the digital context to align five core AI ethics principles we identified in reviews and to spot whether there are any gaps in their current considerations in the context of children. Through this process, we identified some critical gaps in the existing AI ethics principles for children and critical challenges to take these into practice.
