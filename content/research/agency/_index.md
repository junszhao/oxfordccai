Currently **OxfordCCAI** focuses on the following research themes:

## Creating a new paradigm of digital parenting in the AI of age 
* What [technological supports are needed by parents and children](https://oxfordccai.netlify.app/publication/journal-article-2021/)?
* How could a **co-learning** and **collaborative** approach be applied for better digital parenting?
* This research is built on our previous project [KOALA: Kinds Online Anonymity and Lifelong Autonomy](https://koala.web.ox.ac.uk)

## Investigating age-appropriate AI algorithmic design patterns
* What [design practices are applied in current AI systems for children](https://oxfordccai.netlify.app/publication/conference-paper-2022/)?
* How do children [perceive dataficiation](https://www.tiffanygewang.com/publication/paper-placeholder-8/) in existing recommendation platforms (e.g. YouTube or Tiktok)?
* How can **new and ethical** AI algorithmic systems be designed, with more transparency, users' control, and digital autonomy?
* This research is being carried out as part of the [Oxford EWADA Project](http://ewada.ox.ac.uk; 2022-25), investigating new ways to enable data autonomy.
## Supporting developers to build age-appropriate AI applications
* What [existing practices](https://oxfordccai.org/publication/conference-paper-2021/) are adopted by developers for building privacy-friendly apps for children?
* What **tools** are needed to better [support the developers](https://oxfordccai.org/publication/conference-paper-2023-3/)?
