Children are often regarded not have the competence for agency or decision making. However, it does not mean that their best interests should not be respected, their voices are not included in the process of innovations.

Children are often protected or restricted in our technology designs, instead of being nurtured or equipped with agency to recognise manipulations, misinformation or behaviour engineers. This has the danger of dehumanising children and their rights. Put children, and all children, into the centre of ethics principles is foundational and critical. 


Currently **OxfordCCAI** focuses on 1) defining agency for children in the digital context; 2) identifying children's sense of agency; and 3) investigating how to design and support children's agency development in the digital context.
