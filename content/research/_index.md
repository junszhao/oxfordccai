Oxford CCAI currently focuses on the following research themes:

Creating a new paradigm of digital parenting in the AI of age
What technological supports are needed by parents and children?
How could a co-learning and collaborative approach be applied for better digital parenting?
This research is built on our previous project KOALA: Kinds Online Anonymity and Lifelong Autonomy
Investigating age-appropriate AI algorithmic design patterns
What design practices are applied in current AI systems for children?
How do children perceive dataficiation in existing recommendation platforms (e.g. YouTube or Tiktok)?
How can new and ethical AI algorithmic systems be designed, with more transparency, usersâ€™ control, and digital autonomy?
This research is being carried out as part of the [Oxford EWADA Project](http://ewada.ox.ac.uk; 2022-25), investigating new ways to enable data autonomy.
Supporting developers to build age-appropriate AI applications
What existing practices are adopted by developers for building privacy-friendly apps for children?
What tools are needed to better support the developers?
