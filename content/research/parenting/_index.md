In today's digital age, children are growing up surrounded by technology, with their online activities leaving digital footprints that are tracked, analysed, and often monetized. While the digital landscape offers countless opportunities for learning and exploration, it also exposes children to a myriad of datafication risks, including harmful profiling, micro-targeting, and behavioural manipulation.

Families are increasingly concerned about the risks associated with extensive use of the digital technologies. Digital monitoring-based technologies, enabling parents to restrict, monitor or track children’s online activities, dominate the market space. Popular apps as Life 360, Google Family Link, Apple Maps, Qustodio, and Apple screen time, are widespread. According to the latest Ofcom report, in the UK, 70% of parents with children aged 3-17 have used technology to control their child’s access to online content. A similar report is found in the US, with 86% of parents with children aged 5-11 years having reported restricting when and for how long kids can use screens, and 72% using parental controls to restrict how much their child uses screens. 


Research has shown that such approaches have limited efficacy in keeping children out of the bound of the digital space or prolonged screen time usage that parents have hoped for. At the same time, the risks associated with these approaches are much less discussed, such as their potential of undermine family trust relationships or preventing the development of children’s self-regulation skills. With modern families increasingly struggling with their children’s relationship with digital technologies and lack of effective and clear guidance for them, new approaches are urgently needed.


Currently **OxfordCCAI** focuses on further developing and evaluating our [KOALA Hero toolkit](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642283) for supporting a proactive co-engagement betwene parents and children.

We also work together with our collaborators to analyse the impact of the current digital parenting approaches and how they affect families and children's digital well-being.
