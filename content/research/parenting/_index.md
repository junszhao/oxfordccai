In today's digital age, children are growing up surrounded by technology, with their online activities leaving digital footprints that are tracked, analysed, and often monetized. While the digital landscape offers countless opportunities for learning and exploration, it also exposes children to a myriad of datafication risks, including harmful profiling, micro-targeting, and behavioural manipulation.

Families are increasingly concerned about the risks associated with extensive use of the digital technologies. Digital monitoring-based technologies, enabling parents to restrict, monitor or track childrenâ€™s online activities, dominate the market space. 


However, research has shown that such approaches have limited efficacy in keeping children out of the bound of the digital space or prolonged screen time usage that parents have hoped for. At the same time, the risks associated with these approaches are much less discussed.


Currently **OxfordCCAI** focuses on further developing and evaluating our [KOALA Hero toolkit](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642283) for supporting a proactive co-engagement betwene parents and children.

We also work together with our collaborators to analyse the impact of the current digital parenting approaches and how they affect families and children's digital well-being.
