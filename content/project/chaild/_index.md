Support by the first round of [UKRI’s new cross research council responsive mode (CRCRM) pilot scheme](https://www.ukri.org/what-we-do/browse-our-areas-of-investment-and-support/ukri-cross-research-council-responsive-mode-pilot-scheme/), CHAILD aims to address the critical issue of fostering children's digital autonomy in a world where childhood is increasingly intertwined with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, such as connected toys, apps, voice assistants, and online learning platforms. While these technologies offer opportunities to support children's development and learning, they also pose significant risks to their autonomy and agency, primarily through the widespread practices of datafication and manipulation of their digital experiences and behaviors.



CHAILD will bring together a diverse team of computer scientists, learning scientists, social scientists, philosophers, and public policy partners to develop a comprehensive understanding of what algorithmic agency means for children in the digital age. The project will define effective methods for creating AI systems that actively foster and promote children’s agency while respecting their values and rights. To achieve this, the research team will work not only with children to understand their needs but also with a wide range of stakeholders, including parents, teachers, developers, and policymakers.



Professor Shadbolt, the project PI, said: 
> ‘Agency forms the basis of individuals’ ability to regulate their thoughts and actions, based on their beliefs about themselves. However, currently, children’s agency is particularly vulnerable to technological influence and datafication, designed to exploit their autonomy and shape their behaviours and decision-making. This project will co-design principles for creating agency-fostering child-centric AI systems, and produce breakthrough empirical evidence through evaluating prototype designs.’

Dr Zhao, the project co-lead, add:
> We are excited about the upcoming CHAILD project, which will bring together education researchers and philosophers to explore a crucial challenge—what algorithmic agency means for children and how we can design for and measure agency.
