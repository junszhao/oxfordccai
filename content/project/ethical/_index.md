Support by the Oxford University Impact Accelerate Grant, the [Ethical AI Design project](https://aiethicaldesign.org) leverages Oxford team’s research expertise on designing ethical AI systems for children to explore a scalable approach to integrating ethical AI design into innovation and minimises harm to children.

Whilst existing research provides a strong theoretical foundation for developing ethical innovations for children, the lack of practical case-studies and use-cases represents a barrier to deploying this research in an impactful way.

The project aims to work closely with industrial partners to develop a process for implementing ethical designs in the digital context.

We aim to deliver concrete ethical design case studies and an actional ethical design framework. 

The partnership is facilitated by the Oxford Global Challenges Programme (GCP), hosted by Reuben College, Oxford. This research aligns with the EPSRC’s priorities in AI, digitization and data, and responsible innovation and does not overlap with impact activities funded by our other UKRI grants.
