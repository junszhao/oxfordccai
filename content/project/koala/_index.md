The Kids Online Anonymty and Lifelong Autonomy (KOALA) project has been funded by Oxford IAA and Oxford Covid Rebuild Fund from 2018 to 2022.

It has laid our technology and knowledge foundation for the CCAI design lab.

Details information about KOALA's output can be found in our [research page](https://oxfordccai.org/research/parenting/) and the separate [KOALA web site](https://koala.web.ox.ac.uk).
