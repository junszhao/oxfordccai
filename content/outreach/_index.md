Oxford CCAI is launching its first outreach activities -- an after school club to help children better talk and think about AI around them. 

The club runs over 4 weeks, and in each week, researchers from the lab will use a range of activities to help children develop a better ability to talk and think about AI technologies.


* Week 1: we will talk about AI and help children understand how AI is based on data
* Wekk 2: we will help children evaluate the values that drive the design of AI
* Week 3 & 4: we will work with children to (conceptually) design their own good AI platforms.


We publish our workshop format and material under creative commons license. You are mostly welcome to reuse or adapt them. If you do find them useful, we would appreciate it if you could cite our work by link our website. Also, please feel free to drop us a line if you have any feedback.

# Week 1: How AI helps? + Black-box Algorithm!

## Expected learning outcomes for us:
* Understand how students perceive AI
* Understand if children could comprehend concepts related to datafication with our instruction.

## Expected learning outcomes for children:
* Got a big idea about AI and datafication
* Know the three aspects of datafication, i.e. data collection (privacy), datafying (algorithm), and data inference (influence)

## Activity planning
* Warm-up (Verbal discussions / Whole class: ~10 min)

Can anyone please tell me some good things you know that AI can help us? Or some not-so-good things we need to be careful about AI?

* Introduce the drawing task (Small breakup groups: ~25 min)

Children are provided with a bunch of [scenario cards]. 

Each of them was provided with a piece of paper so that they can work as a group/pair, choose a scenario card, and imagine how AI may help them in these scenarios. 

* Black-box Algorithm! (Whole class: ~40-50 min)

We used [three scenarios] to guide children to discuss how AI uses different data to personalise recommendations and how feedback can affect AI results.

## Take home message
In the end of the session, researchers summarise the key discussion points of the day, and provide a take-home message card for children, including the following three messages:
There are three take-home messages for you:
* AI is a smart computer that can make decisions like a human brain, and it could help us in many scenarios.
* AI-based apps like FamilyFun can learn from the data we provide and make personalised recommendations for us.
* AI has pros and cons. The better the data you provide, the better AI will learn, but they are still limited.

## Supplementary materials
We also offer a game for children to further explore AI and algorithms. In this game, children can learn how AI and machine learning can be used to address global problems.
