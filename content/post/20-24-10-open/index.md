On October 7, Dr Jun Zhao visited Frankfurt Goethe University and keynoted on "Design for children’s autonomy in the age of AI".


The abstract of the talk can be found below: 

Autonomy is fundamentally different from data privacy. While upholding children's data privacy is critical, without autonomy, children will miss the opportunity to exercise agency, develop creativity, and cultivate the crucial skill of critical thinking. They may end up living in a crumbling society and a future dictated by algorithms, with little ability to exercise control or self-regulation. In this talk, I will share our recent research on this concern and our experiences in supporting children’s development of algorithmic autonomy. I hope the talk will inspire discussions about the ethical principles of designing for children’s digital autonomy in the age of AI, to better empower them and foster their long-term digital well-being.
