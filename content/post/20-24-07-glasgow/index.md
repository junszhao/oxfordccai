We are excited that Dr Jun Zhao presented her research on digital parental control at the Bi-Annual [International Congress on Infants Studies](https://www.noldus.com/events/icis-2024), a premier academic venue for infant studies. 

As part of a panel chaired by [Professor Denis Mareshcai](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/our-staff/profile/8007610/denis-mareschal) on "What is AI?. Introduction to issues surrounding AI and early Development", Dr Zhao contextualisd the discussion of how we can better support children and families from infancy and early childhood from a computer science perspective.

Dr Zhao said: 

> ``While most of my research has been focused on working with children aged between 6 and 11, we have seen first-hand how children are exposed to AI technologies from infancy, and how their early experience and experience throughout the childhood could have lasting association with the development of their digital habits, self-regulation and parent-child relationship. 
>
> This work reflects many years of research from our group of HCI researchers, 
as well as our collaborations with scientists from other disciplines, such as social science, psychology, philosophy and learning science. ''


The presentation largely draws on our research related to [digital parenting](https://oxfordccai.org/research/parenting/), and our upcoming policy piece to be published by the British Academy.
