# Tech This Out! Episode 9 Recap — “Smart Tool or Subtle Manipulation?”: How AI Is Shaping Children’s Lives


In Episode 9 of Tech This Out!, titled “Smart Tool or Subtle Manipulation?”, 5Rights Youth Ambassador Aisling and Dr. Jun Zhao, senior researcher at Oxford University and co-founder of the Child-Centred AI Design Lab, unpack how AI is impacting children and teens — for better and for worse.


## 📱 How AI Is Already in Kids’ Lives
From making art to doing homework, kids are experimenting with AI in all sorts of creative — and sometimes questionable — ways. AI can feel like a friend, a tutor, or even a personal assistant. But Dr. Zhao reminds us: while AI is incredibly powerful, it doesn’t come with warning labels. And that’s where the risks begin.

Most of us don’t realise how deeply AI is embedded in children’s routines:
- Smart alarms that learn sleep patterns
- Personalised playlists and video recommendations
- Navigation apps that predict traffic
- Chatbots that help (or do) schoolwork

AI is often invisible but influential — shaping children’s choices, preferences, and even their thinking habits.

## ⚠️ I poses severe risks, including over-reliance, manipulation, and mental health

Dr. Zhao warns of the over-reliance on AI tools, especially in learning. When kids let AI do the thinking for them, they risk losing problem-solving skills and critical thinking. And the impact isn’t limited to academics.

AI-driven systems often rely on persuasive algorithms, which are:
- Designed to keep kids engaged
- Tailored to emotional triggers like stress or boredom
- Built to profit from attention, not necessarily support well-being

This subtle manipulation can affect children’s mental health, behavior, and even their sense of identity.

## 🕵️‍♀️ Transparency & Data Concerns
Unlike older technologies (like TV), AI systems collect, analyze, and respond to children’s data — often without clear consent or understanding. Whether it’s chatbots building digital “friendships” or autoplay feeds encouraging endless screen time, these tools can exploit emotional vulnerabilities.
> “Children may think they are making independent choices,” says Dr. Zhao, “but in reality, they are responding to sophisticated manipulations.”


## ✨ The Good News: AI Can Empower
Despite the dangers, there are inspiring examples of positive, thoughtful AI use:
- Students using AI as a brainstorming partner to overcome creative blocks
- Kids designing AI tools to learn sign language or help rural farming
- Personalised AI tools helping toddlers develop impulse control or motor skills
With the right design and intention, AI can enhance creativity, support development, and encourage human connection.

## 📚 The Future of Learning
AI is changing how kids learn:
- 80% of teens aged 13–17 are now using generative AI
- 60% use it for homework or studying
- Tools are emerging that adjust in real time to each student’s ability level

Still, kids trust family over AI when it comes to information — a hopeful sign that human relationships remain central.

## 🧠 Should There Be Rules?
Absolutely. Dr. Zhao and organizations like 5Rights Foundation are leading the charge for better governance and ethics in child-facing AI. New frameworks like the [Children’s AI Design Code](https://5rightsfoundation.com/children-and-ai-code-of-conduct/) aim to:
- Include children’s voices in development
- Require transparency from tech companies
- Address risks like bias, manipulation, and environmental impact
Young people are already advocating for these changes — and they must be included in decision-making.


Aisling, the young host of the episode, closes the episode with a powerful reminder: 

> “AI is like Pandora’s box — it’s out there now, and we need to make sure it brings more good than harm.”
