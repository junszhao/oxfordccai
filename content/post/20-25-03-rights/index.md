On 10-12 March, global experts, policymakers, and children gathered in Georgia to celebrate the the 35th Anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

The [General Comment No. 25 on childrenâ€™s rights in relation to the digital environment](https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/15/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CRC%2fC%2fGC%2f25&Lang=en) was formally adopted by the [United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child(UNCRC)](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx) in February (2021). This has been a landmark in upholding children's digital rights and providing guiding principles for creating technologies used by, assessed by or having impact on children.

It has been an exciting two days, with children and experts discussing both the opportunities AI offers and the numerous open challenges it presents.

Dr Jun Zhao spoke at the panel about "Industry Responsibilities in the context of AI and Child Rights", and called for the industry to take actions by **prioritising children's best interests and rights** in innovations and designs. She also emphasised the need to **invest in ethical designs, promote public awareness, and listen to children's voices**.


With the personal experiences and demands shared by so many participating children, we have no excuse for avoiding change. We must respect children's best interests and make them our top priority.

Her full speech will be shared as part of the conference proceedings.
