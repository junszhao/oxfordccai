We are very pleased to welcome three new members to the Oxford CCAI Lab. Dr Isobel Voysey and Vidminas Vizgirda are joining the UKRI [CHAILD](http://CHAIld.org) project and Boyin Yang is joining the IAA grant on [Ethical AI for Children](http://aiethicaldesign.org).


[Dr Isobel Voysey](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/isobel.voysey/) was previously a DPhil student at University of Edinburgh whose research focuses on developing robots for educating children about animal welfare. Her extensive experience of working and design with children would be a great addition to our research on children's agency in the age of AI


[Vidminas Vizgirda](https://vidminas.github.io) has been with Oxford for two summer internships. We are excited that he is returning to Oxford for a researcher position. His extensive experience in working with AI-based technologies and working with teachers for better access to education resources would provide key inputs to the technical work of CHAILD and our development of support for educators.

[Boyin](https://boyiny.github.io) is a graduating PhD student from University of Cambridge. His research focuses on human-AI interactions and he will work closely with our industrial partner [FamStudio](https://famstudio.co) and create impactful ethical AI innovation frameworks in the context of digital innovations for children.



We are excited of our new team additions and look forward to a productive and impactful year of 2025!
