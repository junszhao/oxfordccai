On November 18, Dr Jun Zhao, joined [Professor Ekaterina Hertog](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ekaterina-hertog-90308191/) and [Professor Netta Weinstein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/netta-weinstein-2650853b/) to talk about parental control technologies and how these may be affecting modern families at the podcast chaired by the Founder and CEO of ParentZone, Vicky Shotbolt. 


The podcast is based on [our recent policy article for the British Academy](https://oxfordccai.org/post/20-24-09-parenting/). In the 40-minute podcast we had a wonderful time discussing with Vicky on topic related to:
- How widespread is the use of this parental control tech, and what are some of the motivations that parents and carers might have for using it?
- Is there more of a tendency to see use of this tech in early years, or is it something that parents are applying across various age ranges?
- Are digital technologies starting to replace conversations?
- What is the impact of using this tech and what, if any, are some of the negative impacts that using it can have on childrenâ€™s wellbeing and family relationships?
- How does self-regulation works and how monitoring might play a limiting role?
- Any recommendations you have from a policy perspective.
