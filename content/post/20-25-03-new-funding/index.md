We are very pleased to share that Oxford CCAI team has recently received two new research grants to boost our AI Ethical Design programme, jointly launched with [FamStudio](https://famstudio.co) and [Oxford Reuben College](https://www.generationai.world).


The first grant, awarded by the Oxford University MPLS Impact Acceleration Grant, will support the team in exploring a scalable approach to integrating ethical AI design into innovation while minimising harm to children. We will collaborate closely with both industry partners and global policy stakeholders.

The second grant, awarded by Innovate UK, will bring together a group of leading designers and child technology innovators to create innovative online training modules and a web-based prototype. This will enable the scalable transfer of knowledge on how to conduct ethical designs for children.

We are grateful for the facilitation provided by the Oxford Global Challenges Programme (GCP), hosted by Oxford Reuben College and led by Dr. Andrew Serazin. GCPâ€™s Generation AI initiative convenes an interdisciplinary research network to ensure AI contributes to a flourishing future. We are excited and thankful for these new opportunities and look forward to producing and launching practical, impactful ethical design guidance and toolkits in 2025
