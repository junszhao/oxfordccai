On November 19, we attended UNICEF's global launch of the *RITEC Design Toolbox* ([RDT](https://www.unicef.org/childrightsandbusiness/workstreams/responsible-technology/online-gaming/ritec-design-toolbox)), part of the Responsible Innovation in Technology for Children (RITEC) initiative in partnership between [UNICEF](http://unicef.org) and the [LEGO Group](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lego-group/) and supported by [The LEGO Foundation](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lego-foundation/). 

The RDT was developed based on the RITEC research about childrenâ€™s well-being in digital play, created with over 750 children in 18 countries. The RDT is a set of practical tools for design teams, supporting the integration of the research findings in their work. 

This toolkit closely aligns with the [child-centred eithcs principles from our research](https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-024-00805-x) and has strong synergy with our newly launched [AI Ethcis Global Challenge](https://aiethicaldesign.org/), co-created with [FamStudio](http://famstudio.net). We look forward to exploring further collaborative relationships among these efforts.
