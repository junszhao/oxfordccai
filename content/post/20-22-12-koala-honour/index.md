Oxford CCAI team won two prestigious awards at the 2023 ACM Conference On Computer-Supported Cooperative Work And Social Computing (ACM CSCW):

- Best Paper Honorable Mention Award

- Impact Recognition Award

for the paper on ‘Don't make assumptions about me!': Understanding Children's Perception of Datafication Online’.

Co-authored by Tiffany Ge Wang, Jun Zhao, Max Van Kleek and Sir Nigel Shadbolt, the paper explored how the phenomena of datafication – users’ actions online being pervasively recorded, tracked, aggregated, analysed, and exploited by online services in multiple ways that include behavioural engineering, and monetisation, are being perceived by children and their families.
