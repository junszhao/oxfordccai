While 2024 is drawing close to an end, we look back at Oxford CCAI of 2024 and share a few upcoming dates for 2025.

## Launch of CHAILD – Children's Agency In the age of AI: Leveraging InterDisciplinarity

We are delighted to announce that we have received an award from the UKRI Cross-Disciplinary Response Mode to support our collaboration with philosophers from Oxford and learning scientists from UCL. This two-year grant, ranked among the top 3 in a highly competitive call, will enable us to explore the definition and measurement of children's digital agency through a user-centred approach.

The project is set to begin in February 2025, and we look forward to welcoming three new colleagues to our team in the new year. Stay tuned for the launch of our white paper in March 2025, where we will share key insights and recommendations.

## Launch of AI Ethics Global Challenge

Supported by Oxford’s Reuben College and in collaboration with FamStudio, we are proud to announce the launch of the AI Ethics Global Challenge Initiative ([visit our website](http://aiethicaldesign.org)). This innovative initiative aims to bridge the gap between academic research and practical applications by co-creating ethical design guidelines in partnership with designers.
Our pre-launch phase, including a Call for Interest, has already been announced (see details on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zelda-yanovich-80ab6b26_gess-dubai-activity-7261957070470418433-voEA?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)), and we are thrilled to build momentum as we prepare for major announcements and activities in 2025.
