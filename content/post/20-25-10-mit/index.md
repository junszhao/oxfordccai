we are excited to share that [Dr Isobel Voysey](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=La4dLCMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr Vidminas Vizgirda](https://vidminas.github.io) have been part of [the MIT Human Flourishing Workshop](https://www.media.mit.edu/events/aha-flourishing-workshop/) between October 14 and 15.


The initiative of ``Benchmarks for Human Flourishing with AI'' is closely aligned with our mission of fostering children's agency in the age of AI.

``The goal of this workshop is to develop rigorous assessment frameworks that evaluate the extent to which AI models contribute to human flourishing while mitigating harms to help model developers build more responsible models''. 

As a result, the workshop aims to ``assist policymakers in regulating models, and inform the general public on which models to use.''



While the team has joined deep discussions about measuring for agency, curiosity, and mental health, we have found that the development of such measurements poses significant open challenges.


We have found the following literature helpful to guide our follow-ups of this important initiative and our ongoing development of measurement of agency, critical thinking, and AI for parenting:
