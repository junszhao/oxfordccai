On November 15, Dr Jun Zhao was invited to be part of the Expert Roundtable with Australian Children's Commissioner, Julia Inman-Grant, during her visit in the UK, hosted by the London School of Economics. The roundtable event brought together leading experts on children's online safety in the UK. Under Cheltenham House rules, we engaged in in-depth discussions on cross-disciplinary and cross-sector approaches to minimizing risks and making technology more human-centered. This collaborative setting provided a unique opportunity to share insights, challenge assumptions, and identify innovative strategies for making the digital world a safer space for children.


One of the highlights of the event was the opportunity to engage directly with Julia, at a time when Australia was preparing to launch new regulations governing children’s interactions with social media. The timing of this conversation underscored the urgency of addressing online safety in an era where children’s use of digital platforms is growing exponentially, bringing both opportunities and risks.

The roundtable also showcased the diversity of expertise necessary to tackle such a complex issue. Attendees represented a broad range of disciplines, including criminology, education, psychology, law, media studies, and computer science. This interdisciplinary approach enriched the discussions, highlighting the need for collaboration across sectors to develop comprehensive solutions. By bringing together experts with varied perspectives and experiences, the event fostered a deeper understanding of the multifaceted nature of online safety and reinforced the importance of working together to create meaningful, lasting change.


We look forward to continued conversation and thank the invitation from Professor Sonia Livingstone and the [DFC](https://www.digital-futures-for-children.net/).
