On 2 July, Dr Zhao presented Oxford CCAI research at the [Oxford Chinese Student and Scholars Association](https://www.oxcssa.org).


In this presentation, Dr. Zhao discussed the current challenges and opportunities of developing child-centered AI for children in the UK. This provided a springboard for discussions with established scholars from China who participated in the discussions remotely, addressing shared challenges observed for children in China, as well as unique challenges arising from cultural and legislative differences."

It was encouraging to see how an ethical approach to creating AI is being actively discussed and researched in China. It was particulalry interesting to hear how recent legislative changes in China are influencing design considerations when building systems for children, while more substaintial changes are still desired.


This presentation was based on prior research from the [KOALA](http://koala.web.ox.ac.uk) project and more recent work by [Ge Wang](https://oxfordccai.org/publication/).
