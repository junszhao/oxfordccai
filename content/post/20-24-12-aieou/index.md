We are incredibly excited to be part of Oxford's newly launched [AI in Education at Oxford University (AIEOU)](aieou.web.ox.ac.uk), led by [Dr Sara Ratner](https://www.education.ox.ac.uk/person/sara-ratner/), [Professor Elizabeth Wonnacott](https://www.education.ox.ac.uk/person/elizabeth-wonnacott/) and [Professor Rebecca Williams](https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/people/rebecca-williams). 

AIEOU aims to promote a research-informed, ethical, human-centered approach to AI in Education through collaboration and knowledge exchange. Working across the four pillars of design, regulation, implementation and impact, researchers at the University of Oxford will collaborate and convene with expert colleagues and key stakeholders from around the world to establish a shared research agenda. We seek to co-create a use case for AI in Education that represents best practice in quality teaching and learning.


Its objectives include:
- To catalyse the establishment of an interdisciplinary community invested in the ethical and responsible use of AI in Education.
- To further interdisciplinary research to understand the potential impacts of AI in Education on teachers and learners.
- To create and collaborate with stakeholders on the production of research-informed outputs for a variety of audiences, including educators and the public.
- To provide for meaningful knowledge exchange between stakeholders to facilitate interdisciplinary and international collaboration resulting in AIED research projects that support best practice in teaching and learning.

AIEOU is situated within the Department of Education, University of Oxford thanks to a funding award from the Social Sciences Division.
