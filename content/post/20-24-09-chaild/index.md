Oxford CCAI is to lead a new project, togeter with UCI and Oxford Philosophy, to address the pressing issue of **fostering children’s digital autonomy** in societies where childhood has become intricately intertwined with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, for instance through connected toys, apps, voice assistants, and online learning platforms.

The two-year project, CHAILD – Children’s Agency In the age of AI: Leveraging InterDisciplinarity, is funded by the first round of [UKRI’s new cross research council responsive mode (CRCRM) pilot scheme](https://www.ukri.org/what-we-do/browse-our-areas-of-investment-and-support/ukri-cross-research-council-responsive-mode-pilot-scheme/).  The CRCRM scheme has been developed to support emerging ideas from the research community that transcend, combine or significantly span disciplines, to ensure all forms of interdisciplinary research have a home within UKRI.  This provides unique opportunities for interdisciplinary research projects like CHAILD.
