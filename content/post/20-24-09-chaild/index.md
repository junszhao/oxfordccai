Oxford CCAI is to lead a new project, togeter with UCI and Oxford Philosophy, to address the pressing issue of fostering children’s digital autonomy in societies where childhood has become intricately intertwined with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, for instance through connected toys, apps, voice assistants, and online learning platforms.

The two-year project, CHAILD – Children’s Agency In the age of AI: Leveraging InterDisciplinarity, is to be funded from the first round of [UKRI’s new cross research council responsive mode (CRCRM) pilot scheme](https://www.ukri.org/what-we-do/browse-our-areas-of-investment-and-support/ukri-cross-research-council-responsive-mode-pilot-scheme/).  The CRCRM scheme has been developed to support emerging ideas from the research community that transcend, combine or significantly span disciplines, to ensure all forms of interdisciplinary research have a home within UKRI. It will support ideas which are not routinely funded, or perceived not to be funded, through existing UKRI responsive mode schemes. Sir Nigel’s project is one of two led by University of Oxford researchers to be funded by the scheme.
