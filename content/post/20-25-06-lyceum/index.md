On June 20, Athens hosted the second Lyceum conference, as part of the [Lyceum Project](https://thelyceumproject.ai). The project was set up to explore some of the key challenges outlined in the landmark white paper published by Professors John Tasioulas and Josiah Ober: [Lyceum Project: AI Ethics with Aristotle](https://www.oxford-aiethics.ox.ac.uk/lyceum-project-ai-ethics-aristotle-white-paper). We could not have chosen a better place to explore these deep questions about a truly `human centred’ approach to the ethics of AI than Lyceum, the birth site of the philosophy school founded by Aristotle.


This year's conference brings together world-leading scholars at the intersection of philosophy and artificial intelligence to explore a vital topic: children in the age of AI. The focus is on how technology can support and enrich a new generation that is growing up with — and potentially being raised by — AI. The event was opened by Mr Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Prime Minister of Greece, and Baroness Beeban Kidron, a long-time advocate for children's rights in the digital age, who led a powerful conversation on AI and children's rights, exploring what it means to be a child in the age of AI.


Dr Jun Zhao was invited to speak on the ‘Age-Appropriate AI Design’ panel, where she was joined by experts from around the world to discuss how to build AI systems that are not only age-appropriate for children but also ethically grounded and tailored to the rights and best interests of children. The panel explored multidisciplinary strategies to ensure that child-centered AI reflects diverse perspectives and responsibly connects research and industry.


The panel was chaired by Dr Mhairi Aitken of the Alan Turing Institute to unpack the following questions:
- What being ``age-appropriate'' means for each respective discipline, and whehter it is the right focus for advancing children’s interests in relation to the development of AI

- How we can move from academic and theoretical research into industry practice, how effectively this currently happens, and what we can do to improve it

- What age-appropriate design of AI in the year 2030 would be like – and what changes we need to make to make this a reality.


We all agree that ensuring age-appropriateness is a good starting point. However, we must not equate it with fully addressing the developmental differences among children. At the same time, we cannot overlook children's fundamental rights — including their rights to respect, agency, and flourishing — when designing technologies intended to protect their safety and address their vulnerabilities.
