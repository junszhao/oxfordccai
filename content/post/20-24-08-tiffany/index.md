Many congraluations to [Dr Ge (Tiffany) Wang](https://tiffanygewang.com), who defended her viva in January 2024 with flying colours, and has begun her new journey in [Stanford HCAI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) with a new one-year postdoctoral research fellowship. She is an incoming Assistant Professor at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Dept of Computer Science (starting in Aug, 2025). 

She began her journey with Oxford CCAI in 2018 as our summer intern (see her [first CHI paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300336)), and she's never left :)

We wish all the best to Dr Ge Wang!! She will do great!
