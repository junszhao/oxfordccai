As the department hosting the [Global Parenting Initiative](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/global-parenting-initiative) — an inspiring effort to expand access to free, evidence-based, playful parenting support in the Global South — we have had an excellent opportunity to share our knowledge and experiences in supporting parenting both digitally and in everyday life.
