Oxford Child-Centred AI (Oxford CCAI) assembles a series of research activities related to designing better AI for children, which is part of [Human-Centred Computing](http://hcc.cs.ox.ac.uk/) at the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford. 

Currently **OxfordCCAI** focuses on the following research themes:

* Creating a new paradigm of digital parenting in the AI of age (see also [KOALA Hero](https://koala.web.ox.ac.uk)):
  * What existing technological supports are needed by parents and children
  * How a **co-learning** and **collaborative** approach could be applied for bettern digital parenting

* Identifying age-appropriate AI algorithmic design patterns (see also [Oxford EWADA Project](http://ewada.ox.ac.uk))
  * How children [perceive dataficiation](https://www.tiffanygewang.com/publication/paper-placeholder-8/) in existing recommendation platforms (e.g. YouTube or Tiktok)
  * How to design **new and ethical** AI algorithmic systems, with more transparency, users' control and digital autonomy

* Identifying ways to support developers to build age-appropriate AI applications: 
  * What [existing practices]() are adopted by developers for building privacy-friendly apps for children
  * What **tools** are needed to better support the developers
